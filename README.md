# This algorithm is used to implement the symmetric-QR method.
## What is symmetric-QR method
This algorithm is used to compute all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. The expected time cost is about 9n<sup>3</sup>, and the expected space complexity is about O(n<sup>3</sup>) during the tridiagonalization and O(n) during the QR iteration.
